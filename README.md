# CoreMathImgProc
Core library to process image of mathematics formula .

This source repository is editable in eclipse and can be build using command:

gradle build

. The building script will generate bin/CoreMathImgProc.jar file. This jar file is the core lib of mathe image processing.

Note that this lib is written by pure JAVA 1.6 and is compatible with any JVM including Android. JMathImgProc is a JAVA example to call this lib and SmartMath is an Android example to call this lib.

Please note that the CoreMathImgProc is still under development. I don't have enough math formula images to train it. And I also don't have enough time to improve the accuracy. Contribution from others are very much welcomed.

If you want to use this lib in your app, please recognize it when your app starts. Also, please make contribution to this lib during your development. Thanks.
